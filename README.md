Project 1: FPGA Based Traffic Light Controller
-->Designed and implemented a traffic control system of a real location in San Jose, California where the given intersection is in harmony with the neighboring intersections with appropriate delay to clear the congestion between them and yields the pedestrian crosswalks.
-->Our design reduced the bottleneck situation at one of the junction and prioritized pedestrians by giving additional switch case along with the normal flow of traffic clock.
-->The design was implemented using Altera's Cyclone II EP2C20F484C7N FPGA and Quartus II 13.0sp software, the simulation was performed using Synopsys VCS.

Project 2: FPGA Based Vending Machine
-->Implemented a modern FPGA Vending machine, which is flexible, programmable, faster than the CMOS based machines and can be reprogrammed.
-->The design was implemented using Altera's Cyclone II EP2C20F484C7N FPGA and Quartus II 13.0sp software.

Project 3: Automated Parking Ticket Generator using FPGA
-->Proposed a design which can automatically generate parking tickets for illegally parked vehicles.
-->Implemented a design for detecting if a vehicle is parked at any of the no permitted parking spots and then sending a text message using the ESP8266 Wi-Fi, which is integrated with the IFTTT applet.
The ESP8266 was preprogrammed using the AT commands using the Arduino IDE.
